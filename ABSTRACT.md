<H1 align="center"> ABSTRACT </H1>

The aim and motive for designing a “blood bank management system” is to automate the management process and improve the efficiency with which the work is done. Blood Banks are a very essential part of our society today. They are the reason why the patients in the hospital are able to get blood on time thus, saving their lives. The main purpose of a blood bank is to collect blood and separate it into its various components so they can be used most effectively according to the needs of the patient. Red blood cells carry oxygen, platelets help the blood clot, and plasma has specific proteins that allow proper regulation of coagulation and healing. The purpose of the blood bank management system is to simplify and automate the process of searching for blood in case of emergency and maintain there cords of blood donors, recipients, blood donation programs and blood stocks in the bank. This is done by using an email which is sent to the person who is registered to the blood bank via SMTP server, Machine learning algorithms will also be used to predict the requirement of any blood group in the future.
